# RecipeBox Proposal

_Not yet finalized! We'll make sure to have the final version committed by the due date._

## Title / What / Why

RecipeBox is a social media platform to share your favorite at-home recipes and find your favorites quickly and easily. Currently, when searching for a recipe online, popular search engines forward you to the most popular websites that belong to large companies or networks. These sites often have skewed rating systems or bring you to large companies as opposed to comfortable at-home recipes. Even if you do use the websites shown to you from search engines, you have a nice all-in-one home for your favorite cooking recipes as opposed to searching for all the links you may have saved across various different sites.

## Who / How / Scope

RecipeBox is a platform for anyone who want to find new recipes outside their comfort zone or share recipes they want to bring to anyone else out there who's curious. Everyone needs to eat, and, in the words of Chef Gusteau, anyone can cook. RecipeBox will leveral the common interfaces of social media platforms, such as likes , comments, and following your favorite at-home chefs, while leveraging intuitive browsing features to search for new recipes or ones similar to your favorites. The platform will allow you to post recipes that are not only viewable by your followers but in a general search feature. You can also save your own favorite recipes so that your go-to recipe box is ready at your fingertips when you're next in the kitchen. Based on how we have designed the project, it has an amount of work that can be appropriately distributed amongst a group of five programmers seeing as it incorporates a number of features yet are not too algorithmically complex for an undertaking done by five people.
