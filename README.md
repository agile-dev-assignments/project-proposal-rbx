# RecipeBox

## What is RecipeBox?

RecipeBox is a social media platform where users can easily find and share recipes.

## Why is RecipeBox needed?

Currently, when searching online for a recipe, it's hard to know which ones are the best, since they are typically spread across different sites with different rating systems. In addition, Google's search algorithms tend to display sites belonging to food related brands and tv channels, as opposed to blogs and smaller sites with family recipes. There also is no easy, efficient way of saving your favorite recipes or recipes that you want to try out in the future as they are spread across these various sites.

## How will RecipeBox solve these problems?

Users seeking to share their recipes can post them to their profiles. Those looking to find recipes can do so via the browsing feature, through which they will be able to search by keywords and/or tags (such as cuisine, course, etc).

RecipeBox also incorporates many of the features that are common to social media, such as follows, likes, and comments. Following a user allows you to keep up with your friends and your favorite chefs! Liking a recipe adds it to your recipe box (so that you can easily find it again in the future) and double as the rating system for the platform.

## Who would benefit from RecipeBox?

Lots of people love to share their family recipes and the recipes that they create. There are also many people out there who want to learn to cook or learn new recipes. RecipeBox is the perfect platform for both groups and anyone in between.

## Why is the scope of the project appropriate?

Since our proposed project is well defined, we believe that we will be able to plan accordingly in order to properly distribute work and allocate time. This will enable us to complete the project within the allotted time frame.

This project is appropriate for a team of 4-6 programmers due to its many features and the complex algorithms that some of them require.
